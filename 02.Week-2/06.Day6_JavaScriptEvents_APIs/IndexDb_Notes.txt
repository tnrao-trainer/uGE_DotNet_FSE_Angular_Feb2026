
What is IndexedDB?

IndexedDB is a client-side database built into modern web browsers that allows websites to store large amounts of structured data locally on the user’s device.

Note:   It works like a NoSQL database inside the browser.


Simple Definition:

IndexedDB is a browser-based database used to store structured data persistently using key-value pairs and objects.

Web applications sometimes need to store data without internet connection.

		Offline web apps
		To-do list apps
		Notes applications
		Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
		Caching API responses
