Arrays in JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	let  ar1 =  [];	// empty array 
	let  ar2 =  [10,20,30,40];		// array with elements 
	let  ar3  =  new Array(5);		// array with size no elements  
	
	
	ar1.length	:		property which returns no. of items in the array 
	
	
Traverse array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	  // access items of array  
	for(let i = 0; i < ar1.length; i++)
	{
		console.log(ar1[i]);
	}
	
	for(let  i in  ar1)
	{
		console.log(ar1[i]);
	}
	
	
	for(let  item  of   ar1)
	{
		console.log( item );
	}
	
	
	
	
	
1. push(item)
2. pop()
3. splice(start_index,  count )	

		ar.splice(2,  1);		//  delete only one item i.e 2nd index 
		ar.splice(2);	//  deletes all items from 2nd index 
		ar.splice(0);	//  deletes all items  
4. indexOf()
		
			ar.indexOf(item)	---	returns the index
			
5.  map()

			
		syntax:   	ar1.map(callback);
							ar1.map(Math.sqrt);
			
 

String to Number 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
		
Number()
parseInt()
parseFloat()



Arrow functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as a more concise way to write function expressions, using the => syntax. They are a popular feature in modern JavaScript, 



let s1  =    {id : 10256, name : "Scott", course : "React"};
let s2  =      {id : 10257, name : "Smith", course : "Angular"};

   let studentsArray = [
                {id : 10256, name : "Scott", course : "React"},
                {id : 10257, name : "Smith", course : "Angular"},
                {id : 10258, name : "Sam", course : "Vue"},
                {id : 10259, name : "Sandy", course : "Node"},
                {id : 10260, name : "Stephen", course : "Express"},
            ];



find()
findIndex()
filter()

Asynchronous programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			a.  What is asynchronous programming?
			
				-->  Synchronous systems execute tasks sequentially, blocking progress until each operation completes, ensuring a strict, predictable order.   
				
				-->  Conversely, asynchronous systems allow tasks to run concurrently without waiting, improving efficiency and responsiveness by not blocking threads during I/O operations
			
				Eg:    AJAX -- asynchronous JavaScript and Xml 
						 to communicate with server (api's)			
			
			b.  Why do we use promises in javascrpt?
			
					-->   in old versions, depends on the callbacks 
					-->   in es6 (2025), promises concept was introduced 
					-->   used to implement asynchronous programming easily 
					
						Promises are used in JavaScript to manage asynchronous operations (like fetching data from a server or running a timer) in a more structured, readable, and efficient way than traditional callbacks, thereby avoiding "callback hell". A promise acts as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future.		
					
			
			c.   What is the significance of async and await keywords?
					
					--> Simplify promise usage 
					-->  The async and await keywords in JavaScript are used to write asynchronous code in a clean, synchronous-like manner, making it much easier to read, write, and maintain. They are essentially syntactical sugar built on top of standard JavaScript Promises. 
			
			d.   Why do we use fecth()  in javascrpt?
			
				 -->   fecth()   --- used to implement ajax for api calls (server communication)
				 -->   fecth build on top of promise concept
				
				
					fecth(url).then( callback );
					fecth(url).then( (response) =>  
					{
								
					});
